# CAR-BLACK-BOX
#Introduction:
A Black Box is a device designed to record critical information leading up to a collision. The goal of this project is to implement the core functionalities of a car Black Box using a PIC-based microcontroller, supported by additional peripherals. Events will be logged in EEPROM, enabling the storage and retrieval of vital data.

The system will record details such as the car's speed and gear positions. Additionally, users can adjust the time settings as needed. Access to the recorded information is restricted to individuals who know the password, ensuring data security. The system also allows users to change the password if it is compromised, enhancing the overall security and usability of the device.
